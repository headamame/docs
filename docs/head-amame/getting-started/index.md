## Pre-Build Checklist

Before ordering components or starting to print, complete this checklist:

### üìã Planning Phase

- [ ] Read complete documentation (estimated 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Watch build videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@headamame)
- [ ] Join [Discord community](https://discord.gg/headamame) for support
- [ ] Assess skill level against requirements
- [ ] Confirm workspace and tool availability

### üõ†Ô∏è Tool Verification

- [ ] [Review required tools list](required-tools.md)
- [ ] Verify 3D printer compatibility
- [ ] Check soldering station functionality
- [ ] Ensure measurement tools are available

### üí∞ Budget Planning

- [ ] Calculate total project cost using our [BOM](../technical/bom.md)
- [ ] Account for shipping costs and taxes
- [ ] Plan for potential material failures/reprints
- [ ] Consider upgrade options for future

### üì¶ Component Sourcing

- [ ] Review [Bill of Materials](../technical/bom.md)
- [ ] Check component availability in your region
- [ ] Place orders with recommended suppliers
- [ ] Verify delivery timeline matches printing schedule

## First-Time Builder Recommendations

!!! tip "New to DIY headphones?"
    
    **Start with our proven path:**
    
    1. **Begin with the [tool guide](required-tools.md)** - Don't skip any recommended tools
    2. **Use our exact [BOM suppliers](../technical/bom.md)** - Avoid substitutions on your first build
    3. **Follow [print settings](../build-guide/3d-printing.md) exactly** - Our settings are thoroughly tested
    4. **Take photos during assembly** - Helpful for troubleshooting and community sharing
    5. **Join Discord BEFORE starting** - Get real-time help when issues arise

## Common First-Build Mistakes

Learn from others' experiences and avoid these common pitfalls:

!!! warning "Print Quality Issues"
    
    **Problem**: Poor layer adhesion on curved surfaces  
    **Solution**: Use our tested print orientation and support settings
    
    **Problem**: Dimensional inaccuracy affecting fit  
    **Solution**: Calibrate your printer with test prints first

!!! warning "Component Issues"
    
    **Problem**: Wrong driver model ordered  
    **Solution**: Triple-check part numbers against our BOM
    
    **Problem**: Insufficient wire gauge for connections  
    **Solution**: Use exactly the wire specifications we recommend

!!! warning "Assembly Problems"
    
    **Problem**: Forcing parts that don't fit properly  
    **Solution**: Stop and troubleshoot - parts should fit with minimal force
    
    **Problem**: Skipping the test phase  
    **Solution**: Always test electrical connections before final assembly
