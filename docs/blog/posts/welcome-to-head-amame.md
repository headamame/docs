# Welcome to head(amame) - Open Source DIY Headphones

Today marks an exciting milestone - the public launch of head(amame), our open-source DIY headphone platform that brings high-end audio engineering to makers worldwide.

## Our Mission

At head(amame), we believe that exceptional audio shouldn't be locked behind proprietary designs and premium price tags. Our mission is to democratize high-quality headphone design through:

- **Complete openness**: All design files, documentation, and software freely available
- **Community-driven development**: Improvements come from builders like you
- **Educational focus**: Understanding how your audio gear works
- **Maker-friendly engineering**: Designed for 3D printing and DIY assembly

## What Makes Us Different

### üîì Truly Open Source
Unlike other "open" projects that hold back critical designs, every aspect of head(amame) is available under the MIT license. This means:

- Full CAD source files (not just STLs)
- Complete electrical schematics
- Acoustic simulation models
- Manufacturing documentation
- This very website's source code

### üéØ Proven Performance
head(amame) isn't just a cool project - it delivers audio quality that rivals commercial headphones costing 3-5x more:

- Measured frequency response within ¬±3dB from 20Hz-20kHz
- Low distortion across the audible spectrum  
- Comfortable for extended listening sessions
- Professional-grade build quality when assembled correctly
