## Our Community Values

<div class="component-card">
### 🤝 **Inclusive & Welcoming**
Everyone starts somewhere. We celebrate first builds as enthusiastically as expert modifications. Questions are always welcome, and helping others is how we all learn.
</div>

<div class="component-card">
### 🔬 **Science-Based Approach**
We value measurements, testing, and documented results. Subjective opinions are welcome, but objective data drives our design decisions.
</div>

<div class="component-card">
### 🌍 **Open Source Spirit**
Everything we create is freely shared. Improvements benefit everyone, and attribution is how we honor contributors.
</div>

<div class="component-card">
### 🎯 **Quality Over Quantity**
We focus on building exceptional headphones rather than rushing to market. Every design iteration is thoroughly tested and documented.
